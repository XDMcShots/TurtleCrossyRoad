To play the game, download these 4 files in an appropriate IDE and run the main.py file 

The Game gets proggresively harder depening on how many times you finish the cross line (the level).

Press the up arrow on your keyboard to move your turtle upwards, no other key works apart from this. 

If your character touches a car (the colored rectangles), then the game is over and you must click the screen to exit the code.
